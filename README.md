# Codelab Chat App with Firebase - Mobile App Dev Summer 2021 HW 2

## Description

This app is a simple app that allows users to send chat messages. Users login with an email and can send text messages or images. Texts and images are stored in a Firebase container.

### Dependencies

* In order to run the code you need to download all files and folders. Main changes were made to the Kotlin files within the app/src directory. Both build.gradle files (inside and outside of app directory) are going to be needed as they hold the dependencies.
* You will also have Android studio and an emulator setup

### Installing

* Download the entire appdev_hw2 repo. Save them into a directory titled "build-android-start"

### Executing program

* Download npm and node.js. In the terminal type:
   ```
   npm install -g firebase-tools@latest
   ```
   followed by
   ```
   firebase emulators:start --project=demo-friendlychat-android
   ```
   Do not close the terminal window. Leave it open while running the app in the emulator. Go to http://localhost:4000/ in your browser once commands have finished. This will let you access the Firebase storage in real time.
   
* Open the "build-android-start" folder in Android Studio and run with an Android Emulator.
